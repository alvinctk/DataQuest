    "The three key data structures in Pandas are:\n",
    "- Series objects (collections of values)\n",
    "- DataFrames (collections of Series objects)\n",
    "- Panels (collections of DataFrame objects)\n",

    "In this mission, we will focus on the Series Object. \n",

    "Series objects uses NumPy arrays for fast computation, but add valuable features to them for analyzing data. \n",
    "While Numpy arrays use an integer index, for example, Series objects can use other index types, such as a string index. Series objects also allow for mixed data types, and use the NaN Python value for handling missing values.\n",

    "A Series object can hold many data types, including: \n",
    "- `float` - For float values\n",
    "- `int` - For integer values\n",
    "- `bool` - For Boolean values\n",
    "- `datetime64[ns]` - For date & time, without time zone\n",
    "- `datetime64[ns, tz]` - For date & time, with time zone\n",
    "- `timedelta[ns]` - For representing differences in dates & times (seconds, minutes, etc.)\n",

The FiveThirtyEight team recently released a data set containing scores for all movies that have substantive user and critic reviews on IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and Fandango. **We'll be working with the file `fandango_score_comparison.csv`**, which you can download from their Github repository. Here are some of the columns in the data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FILM` - Film name\n",
    "- `RottenTomatoes` - Average critic score on Rotten Tomatoes\n",
    "- `RottenTomatoes_User` - Average user score on Rotten Tomatoes\n",
    "- `RT_norm` - Average critic score on Rotten Tomatoes (normalized to a 0 to 5-point system)\n",
    "- `RT_user-norm` - Average user score on Rotten Tomatoes (normalized to a 0 to 5-point system)\n",
    "- `Metacritic` - Average critic score on Metacritic\n",

    "## Data alignment\n",
    "One of pandas' core tenets is data alignment. Series objects align along indices, and DataFrame objects align along both indices and columns. With Series objects, pandas implicitly preserves the link between the index labels and the values across operations and transformations, unless we explicitly break it. With DataFrame objects, the values link to the index labels and the column labels. Pandas also preserves these links, unless we explicitly break them (by reassigning or editing a column or index label, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "This core tenet allows us to use pandas effectively when working with data, and offers a big advantage over using NumPy objects. For Series objects in particular, this means we can use the standard Python arithmetic operators (+, -, *, and /) to add, subtract, multiply, and divide the values at each index label for two different Series objects.\n",
